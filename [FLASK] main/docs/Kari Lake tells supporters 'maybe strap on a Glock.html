We’re going to put on our helmet, or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God.

Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.She went on to suggest she would carry multiple firearms to avert crime before implying her political opponents were taking away freedoms of speech and gun rights.“We’re not going to be the victims of crime. We’re not going to have our Second Amendment taken away,” Lake said. “We’re certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.”Alex Nicoll, a Lake campaign spokesman, said Lake’s words should not be misconstrued.“Kari Lake is clearly talking about the Second Amendment right for Arizonans to defend themselves,” he said in a statement.Lake’s comments happened on the eve of former President Donald Trump’s trial on criminal charges in New York stemming from payments made during his 2016 campaign to Stormy Daniels, who is known for her roles in pornographic videos and who has said she had sexual relations with Trump.Trump’s historic trial has led New York authorities to gird for the risk of violence.Since the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a pro-Trump mob at the U.S. Capitol, the specter of politically inspired violence has loomed especially large in a deeply divided country.</body></html>
