On Wednesday, he said his government was "determined to free the country from the scourge" of Maoist rebels.The Maoist insurgency began in West Bengal state in the late 1960s and has since spread to more than a third of India's 600 districts.The rebels control large areas of several states in a "red corridor" stretching from north-east to central India.Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen.But clashes between security forces and rebels are still common, killing scores of people every year.</body></html>
