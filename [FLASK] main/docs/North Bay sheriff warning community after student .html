Responding authorities determined that the incident was related to a student game called “Senior Assassin Challenge.” In the game, students shoot toy water guns at each other.“Nationwide, it appears various police agencies are encountering juveniles displaying toy water guns in public places which resemble real firearms,” according to a public advisory statement from the sheriff’s office. Many of these uneasy encounters are connected to the “Senior Assassin Challenge” game.A photo that accompanied the advisory (below) shows one such imitation water gun, which MCSO said is similar to the one located on a high school student during Tuesday’s investigation.“While the criminal violation for displaying this type of water gun is relatively minor,” the sheriff’s office said, making note that the offense is an infraction, “the implications of mistaking this weapon as real are significant and could lead to serious injury or death.”The Marin County Sheriff’s Office advised parents to inform their children of the dangers and seriousness of this behavior. “There are many other ways to spend time pulling pranks and having fun in your senior year than using imitation firearms,” MCSO said.In October 2013,  by Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Erick Gelhaus as Lopez was reportedly walking in public with an airsoft BB gun designed to resemble an AK-47 rifle. Gelhaus would be cleared of all charges in the fatal shooting.</body></html>
