There were no injuries reported, and Viola's handlers were able to corral her after about 20 minutes without having to call law enforcement.While this story ended safely for all involved, the outcome of a zoo escape in Ohio was far more tragic.It started with a phone call to 911 on Oct. 18, 2011. A woman reported seeing a bear and lion roaming around.“There's a bear and a lion out?” the operator asked, as  of Worcester, Massachusetts.“Yeah,” said the woman, “Right up behind us.” The caller was asked to repeat that last part. “Yeah,” she said. “They're chasing Terry's horses.”That day, Terry Thompson had released 56 exotic animals from his 70-acre farm outside Zanesville, about 55 miles east of Columbus, before taking his own life.Fearing for the public's safety, Muskingum County Sheriff's deputies and other law enforcement personnel killed about 50 of the loose animals, which included 18 Bengal tigers -- an endangered species with fewer than 3,000 left in the wild -- 17 lions, six black bears, three cougars, two grizzly bears, two wolves and a baboon, .Six surviving animals were taken to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, five of which were  about six months later.Terry Thompson, 62, had been released from a federal prison in August and freed from a Cincinnati-area halfway house on Sept. 30 after a yearlong sentence for possessing illegal firearms.
