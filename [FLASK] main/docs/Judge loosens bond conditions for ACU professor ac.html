The charges are in connection to incidents dating back to 2018.Wadlington was free Wednesday from the Taylor County Jail on a $75,000 bond, according to online jail records.On April 11, Solis presented his motion to allow Wadlington permission to contact his youngest children, who were not named in the complaint, via phone calls and video calls.Solis also asked that Wadlington have permission to visit his youngest children when supervised by a list of approved family members and to see his youngest children at the family residence when supervised by his wife Mary Wadlington.In court, Solis presented evidence that Wadlington passed a polygraph test and asked Propst to consider the "strength of the evidence."Solis sought to show that the allegations of abuse were fabricated."The children thrive on drama," Solis said.He brought up an interview with one of Wadlington's accusers in which the accuser stated, "It was just a way of me getting out of the house."Assistant District Attorney Erin Stamey said, "All you have is probable cause."Stamey said the prosecution was concerned Wadlington's wife would be the supervisor of the visits with the youngest children, citing accusations she failed to report the alleged abuse at the time it occurred.Propst ruled partially in Wadlington's favor by allowing phone calls and supervised visits with the approved list of family members.
