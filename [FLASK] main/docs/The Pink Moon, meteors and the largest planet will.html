Even if the moon — which will be  during the shower’s peak—obscures the meteor show, Tuesday evening’s Pink Moon event will present an equally impressive sight, as it’s visible with the largest planet in our solar system in the night sky.Unfortunately, the Pink Moon isn’t named for the color it looks in the sky — it’ll still appear as the bright white orb in the sky we’re used to seeing.It’s named so because it appears around when  bloom.“The tribes of the northeastern United States called this the Pink Moon,” . “Named after the herb moss pink, also known as creeping phlox, moss phlox, or mountain phlox, a plant native to the eastern USA that is one of the earliest widespread flowers of spring.Other names for the moon include the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon and the Full Fish Moon.The Pink Moon will reach peak illumination at 5:59 p.m. Mountain time on Tuesday, . But because it will be below the horizon in the late afternoon, you’ll want to wait until later to see the full moon.The moon will rise in Boise at 8:46 p.m. on Tuesday and set at 6:54 a.m. on Wednesday. Shortly before the moon sets will also be the best time to catch a glimpse of the Lyrid meteor shower, which will be best viewable when light pollution from the moon and the sun is at its lowest.Although the full moon may make it challenging to see meteors, its light won’t drown out the ability to see Jupiter in the night sky.As the moon begins to rise in the east-southeast, Jupiter rises on the west-northwest horizon, in the opposite direction of the moon. Jupiter is only viewable from Boise for a couple of weeks in April, not rising above the horizon in early April or the month’s final week.Jupiter is easy to spot because it looks like a bright star that isn’t twinkling along the horizon. The National Weather Service in Boise  mostly clear to partly cloudy skies heading into next week, meaning it shouldn’t be too difficult to see the full moon, Jupiter and maybe even meteors.If you miss the Pink Moon in April, you’ll have eight more chances to see a full moon in 2024.
