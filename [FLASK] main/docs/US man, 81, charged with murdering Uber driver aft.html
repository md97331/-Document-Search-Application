She was unaware of the threats he had received, officials say."Ms Hall, suffering from medical conditions and unarmed, made no threats or assaults toward Mr Brock, and made no demands, other than to ask about the package she was sent to retrieve," the sheriff's office said in a statement.Mr Brock then allegedly pointed a gun at Ms Hall and demanded she reveal the identity of the caller. She tried to leave, saying she would call police.In the dashcam footage, Mr Brock is heard demanding that Ms Hall give him her phone.He also refused to allow her to leave, police said.When she returned to her car, there was a "scuffle at the door of Ms Hall's vehicle", police say, which ended in Mr Brock allegedly shooting her multiple times.He then called 911, according to a police report, and was found bleeding with an injury to his head and ear when law enforcement arrived.Ms Hall was then taken to hospital, where she died from her injuries.The sheriff's office is still searching for the scam callers."The Clark County Sheriff's Office would like to take the opportunity to again remind residents, especially our older citizens, that no Law Enforcement Agency or Court will make contact with anyone in the manner of this case to solicit cash for bail," the office said.The sheriff added that residents should "use extreme caution when being contacted unexpectedly by subjects claiming to be relatives incarcerated in a correctional facility".Uber said in a statement that the account of the person who hired Ms Hall has been banned."This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts continue to be with Loletha's loved ones as they grieve," the company said."We have been in contact with law enforcement and remain committed to supporting their investigation."</body></html>
