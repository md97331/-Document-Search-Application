<html><head><title>Will the constellations ever change?</title></head><body>When we look up at the night sky, we see familiar stars and constellations that have been visible for thousands of years. Yet stars do not last forever. They live and die, though on exceptionally long timescales. But how long will it take for these changes to be visible in the constellations visible from Earth?Much of this depends on the lifetimes of certain stars. Most stars in our galaxy are small. However, in the  we see, large and bright stars are overrepresented. The larger the star, the shorter its lifetime and the sooner it will disappear from our sky.Stars about eight times the  and larger will undergo a core-collapse  at the ends of their lifetimes. These massive explosions are impressive sights and signal stars disappearing from our sky.Many astronomers think , a red supergiant star, will be the first star to disappear from our sky. It could vanish . When it explodes, it will be brighter than the  — bright enough to be seen during the day or cast shadows in the night.Another star of interest is Eta Carinae, which is visible mostly from the Southern Hemisphere. This  system is hundreds of times the . Around 180 years ago, Eta Carinae. The star survived, but its next outburst may result in a supernova that destroys the star.It's difficult to predict the exact moment these stars will explode, but one clue could come from ghostly particles called . During a supernova, most of the energy is not in the optical but rather emitted as neutrinos."The neutrino production from Betelgeuse will ramp up in the last phases of its life so that in the last day, it will emit enough neutrinos that our current detectors will see it," said , a supernova expert at the University of Illinois. We'll have about 24 hours' notice before the star explodes.Such a massive explosion may sound dangerous to Earthlings, but we're too far away for it to have an impact, Fields said. For life on  to be affected, a supernova would have to be within 8 to 10 parsecs — about 2 million times the ."If we had anything that close, it would be by far be the ," Fields told Space.com. "They're not subtle. They don't sneak up on you."Although a supernova may be more dramatic, our constellations will undergo a more radical change from the movement of .Every star in our galaxy is moving. When viewed from Earth, this is called  which is how much the apparent location of the star seems to change.  is the fastest star, whipping by at 10 arc seconds a year. This means that in 180 years, the star moves the .Most stars travel much more slowly than that. So the constellations we see today are basically the same as the ancient Greeks saw them. Over tens of thousands of years, however, stellar motions will add up to radically affect the shapes of the constellations.Take the , which is an  in the . The central five stars of the Big Dipper not only appear close together in our sky but are physically close to one another as well. Born together, these stars are a "moving group" that travel across the sky together. The stars on each end, however, have their own directions and motion. "Over , the Big Dipper will morph and won't look like a spoon at all," Fields said. "Enough of it will change that it will look 'freaky deaky' after tens of thousands of years."Because these changes will be visible over timescales of tens of thousands of years — rather than tens of millions of years, which is the timescale in which we expect many supernovas — our constellations will be affected by proper motion long before the stars vanish from the sky.Earth's motion will also affect our night sky. Our planet wobbles like a top, changing the direction of the North Pole. This is called precession.Related Stories:— — — "The Egyptians used to have a different ," said Kayleigh Excell, a supernova researcher who works with Fields. "At the time of the Pyramids of Giza, [their north star] would be Alpha Draconis," also known as .Our constellations will change, but not just because stars die or move. New stars are actively being born in our galaxy. These stars will eventually emerge from their . If they're bright enough, these stars will take their place in new constellations in our sky.</body></html>
