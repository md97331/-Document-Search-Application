they are legally required to produce a "climate change plan" which details how they will achieve their targets.That plan is now long delayed and the Climate Change Committee confirmed last month that the flagship 2030 target was now beyond reach.So, it is just not possible to produce that plan any more.An option would be to set new targets within the existing legislation and then produce a plan.But one official described those annual targets as nothing more meaningful than a straight line on a graph.So abolishing them altogether - and perhaps setting a lower 2030 target - seems the most likely course of action available.</body></html>
