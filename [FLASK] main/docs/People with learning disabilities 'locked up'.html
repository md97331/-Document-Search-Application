All I wanted was peace and quiet and there were a lot of people around me who wanted their own needs to be met."Some of them were quite noisy and shouting.”Sophie was later moved out of the county to another secure hospital, which was “like being in a prison”.She said: “You were fenced in and you didn’t really have much freedom. It wasn’t really for me."Cath Dyer's autistic daughter Claire was sent to a secure hospital in 2014 after being deemed "too dangerous"."It very important that our voices are heard," said Mrs Dyer, from Swansea."As parents we know what places are right for our children, and if we say we can cope and we want our child with us then listen to what we're saying."She added that Claire, who was 24 when sectioned for her "challenging behaviour", wasn't helped by being placed in Brighton - a 10-hour round trip away from home.Gradually, however, she was allowed home visits, which increased in length until she was eventually de-sectioned."Nearly 10 years later and she's still at home with us," added Mrs Dyer."Now we have support from a fantastic care company which is very person-centred, and with them Claire is thriving."The Welsh government said it took the care of vulnerable people "very seriously".It added: "We are committed to reducing the number of people with a learning disability who are housed in a hospital setting.“We do not agree that people are being systematically detained inappropriately in mental health units."It said data from health boards suggested there were about 140 Welsh patients in specialised inpatient services in Wales and England.</body></html>
