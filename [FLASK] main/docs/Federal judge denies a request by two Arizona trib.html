Ignoring the tribes' claims under the Historic Preservation Act was illegal and immoral, he said."Pattern Energy/SunZia don't care about the San Pedro Valley," Silver said. "To them, it is only about cash. It is cheaper to build a new line through the San Pedro Valley instead of through an already degraded corridor through Tucson, no matter the historic harm to the tribes and the valley."SunZia will traverse the middle and lower San Pedro Valley, and the tribes and conservation groups believe the valley’s ecological and historical values are at risk from the project. They hoped BLM would consider an alternative route to avoid irreparable damage.Construction began in September, and tribes asked BLM to halt work to conduct a proper survey with input from the tribes, identifying Traditional Cultural Properties (TCP) that are protected under the National Register of Historic Places.Because SunZia’s route was finalized in 2015, the judge ruled the tribe’s injunction was “time-barred.” As construction has already begun and the route finalized nine years ago, the court believes it is too late to challenge the final route.BLM said it requested feedback from the tribes during the planning process and invited them to consult on cultural and historic inventories and visual assessment surveys in the valley.The court also concluded that BLM is in compliance with the Preservation Act and is not obligated to reroute the project to avoid the valley. BLM claims the project route avoids direct impacts on all culturally significant sites identified in the area and will minimize adverse impacts to the valley overall.Pattern Energy said following this decision, construction will continue as planned, with a goal of finishing it by 2026. ... by .</body></html>
